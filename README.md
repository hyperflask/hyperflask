A [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com)-based (very) opiniated Python web framework where all the tech choices have been made. Hyperflask combines multiple Flask extensions and frontend libraries into a seamless experience.

**This project is part of the [Hyperflask Stack](https://hyperflask.dev).**

Features and technologies:

 - Web framework built on top of [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) as a set of extensions
 - File-based and/or app-based routing
 - A new file format combining python code in frontmatter and html templates to define routes
 - SQL focused ORM with [sqlorm](https://github.com/hyperflask/sqlorm), optimized for [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/)
 - Modern asset pipeline using [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) and [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
 - Deep integration with [htmx](https://htmx.org/)
 - Easily create reusable backend and frontend components, compatible with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org)f
 - Build frontend components using Web Components, [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/), [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/) and more. Mix technologies at will.
 - Component library based on [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) with icons from [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/)
 - Seamless reactivity between frontend and backend
 - Authentication and user management with social logins and MFA
 - Static content collections to easily create blogs and manage static content
 - File management with built-in image manipulation and S3 integration
 - Template based emails with [mjml](https://mjml.io) support
 - Background tasks using [dramatiq](https://dramatiq.io/)
 - Push support for realtime pages using [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events)
 - I18n using [gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/)
 - Easily create REST APIs and automatically generate documentation
 - Static, hybrid or dynamic modes for content serving
 - Observable with [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/)

[Hyperflask-Start](https://github.com/hyperflask/hyperflask-start) should be used to create new projects:

 - Dev environment based on [Development Containers](https://containers.dev/)
 - Optimized for VScode with breakpoint debugging for frontend and backend
 - [Mailpit](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit) for email testing
 - Deployments using [Hyperflask-Deploy](https://github.com/hyperflask/hyperflask-deploy)

## Flask extensions

Hyperflask itself is minimal and mostly a collection of Flask extensions seamlessly integrated together.

A good part of these extensions is developed as part of the Hyperflask project. Checkout the [Hyperflask organization page](https://github.com/hyperflask) for a list of all these projects.
